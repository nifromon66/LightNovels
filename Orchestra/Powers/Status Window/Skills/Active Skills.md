[[Active Skills]] are [[Skills]] that are voluntarily activated to have an effect externally. They usually cost [[Resonance Points (RP)]] and sometimes [[Focus Points (FP)]], [[Health Points (HP)]] or even [[Stamina Points (SP)]].

They are limited by the number of [[Active Skills]] Slots on the [[Skill Monolith]] and take the Slots permanently so chose carefully and they can't be stored.
