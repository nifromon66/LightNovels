[[Dimensional Affinity]] will indicate in which dimensions you can act on with your powers as [[Tuners]] but also affect your ability to perceive those [[Dimensions]]and even the ability to accept and use certain [[Skills]] and [[Quantum Artefact]].

Most [[Tuners]] have affinity with the [[Manifest Dimensions]], some have affinity with [[Self Dimensions]] or even [[Hidden Dimensions]].

Dimensional Perception : It's on/off, you can sense them as normally as your true sense, it will use up your [[Focus Points (FP)]] if your sense are overloaded or stop you from perceiving if it's too much. What determines the threshold are the number of [[Dimensions]], the duration of the perception and the understanding of what's being perceived.
