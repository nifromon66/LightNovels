[[Classes]] describe the job of an entity, it is acquired during an Node Advancement Ritual and have specific rewards and effects on the entity that owns it.

When reaching the level cap of a node you can close your knot to attempt a Node Advancement Ritual and receive a class.

Then to advance to the next class you will have to reach level 100 of the next node and have 100% Synchronisation with your current class.

# Rarity

The only rarity a class can have is Unique which is a way to say that you are the only one in the Universe to **currently** have this class.

# Ritual

You will not be able to level up during the period of the ritual.

At the beginning of the Ritual you will have the choice between different classes in accordance to the experience, stats and skills you acquired, your innate affinities and in some cases [[Quantum Artefact]].

Once your choice made you will be able to see the ritual required to advance it can range from killed a certain number of entities of a specific level, acquiring or advancing a specific skill of a specific level, acquiring a certain title or achieve a certain feat. It can have a time limit or not.

At the end of the ritual you will be rewarded with specific stats, skills, titles, affinity or [[Quantum Artefact]] and of course the class you did the ritual for.

If you somehow failed the ritual, you will be given the same choice but the class you have chosen at first will not be available and you will have to do the ritual again but this time for the next class you have chosen.

Some classes will have specific failure punishments will for examples disable an skill, lose stats, lose titles, losing energy points, disabling a body part or even a Dimensional or Spectrum affinity related to the class.

If you fail all your class ritual, you will not be able to advance anymore and undergo [[Quantum Neural Corruption]].

# Synchronisation

A way to quantify how much in tune and acceptance you are with your class.

It increase by using abilities related to the class, time passing, specific actions or achievements but also understanding the class and acting as the class.
