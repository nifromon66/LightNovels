# Dimensions

### Dimensions

[[Dimensions]] are "Environment" in which one-dimensional strings can vibrate at specific frequencies on the [[Spectrum of Reality]], [[Tuners]] can affect the [[Spectrum of Reality]] in those [[Dimensions]] to create supernatural phenomenon in those [[Dimensions]].

There are [[Manifest Dimensions]], [[Self Dimensions]] and [[Hidden Dimensions]].
### Hidden Dimensions

[[Hidden Dimensions]] are external [[Dimensions]] that cannot be perceived immediately as part of reality and are most of the time hidden behind the [[Manifest Dimensions]] or too difficult to imagine for normal beings.

# Organs

### Quantum Neural Corruption

[[Tuners]] unable to withstand the development of [[Quantum Neural Network]] in their brain will transform into brainless monsters called [[Zombies]].

There are no stages, the transformation is extremely fast, there is no warning, it's permanent, it can be caused by innate inability to be [[Tuners]], if you have 0 [[Resonance Points (RP)]] for too much time, if you use abilities beyond your reach, ritual failures or being injured by [[Zombies]] (Which cause [[Quantum Blight]]).

### Quantum Neural Network

A new organ in the brain of [[Tuners]] that enables them see beyond the [[Manifest Dimensions]] to perceive the one-dimensional strings, their vibrations and frequencies and enable them to use [[Skills]].

### Affinity

#### Dimensional Affinity

[[Dimensional Affinity]] will indicate in which dimensions you can act on with your powers as [[Tuners]] but also affect your ability to perceive those [[Dimensions]]and even the ability to accept and use certain [[Skills]] and [[Quantum Artefact]].

Most [[Tuners]] have affinity with the [[Manifest Dimensions]], some have affinity with [[Self Dimensions]] or even [[Hidden Dimensions]].

Dimensional Perception : It's on/off, you can sense them as normally as your true sense, it will use up your [[Focus Points (FP)]] if your sense are overloaded or stop you from perceiving if it's too much. What determines the threshold are the number of [[Dimensions]], the duration of the perception and the understanding of what's being perceived.

#### Spectrum Affinity

The [[Spectrum Affinity]] will define the [[Spectrum of Reality]] you will be able to perceive and manipulate as [[Tuners]], and your ability to accept and use certain [[Skills]] or [[Quantum Artefact]].

### Energy

#### Focus Points (FP)

[[Focus Points (FP)]] define the amount of Willpower and Mental Stamina you have before falling in mental exhaustion and fall asleep. it can be affected by [[Mind]] (Amount of FP, Exhaustion time, Recovery time, Willpower), [[Health Points (HP)]] (If you are injured or close to death, your mind will be affected. If you are in good health you will recover faster), [[Stamina Points (SP)]] (if you are exhausted physically, your mind will be affected), [[Resonance]] (If you use or have affinity with [[Soul Spectrum]], [[Emotional Spectrum]], [[Cognitive Spectrum]] and [[Conceptual Spectrum]] your total MP can be reduced or exhaustion and recovery time can be reduced or augmented).

It can also be influenced by [[Quantum Artefact]] or [[Quantum Card]] with affinity of the [[Soul Spectrum]], [[Emotional Spectrum]], [[Cognitive Spectrum]] and [[Conceptual Spectrum]].

It can also be influenced by the status effects such as : [[Madness]], [[Frostbite]], [[Quantum Blight]], and [[Sleep]].
#### Health Points (HP)

[[Health Points (HP)]] define the amount of vitality you have before death (0 HP). It is affected by [[Health]](Amount of HP, How hard it is to lower, Recovery time), [[Stamina Points (SP)]](Will affect Recovery time) [[Focus Points (FP)]](Will to remain alive), and [[Resonance]](If you use or have affinity with the [[Vital Spectrum]], [[Conceptual Spectrum]] and [[Material Spectrum]], it can affect total HP and Recovery time).

It can also be influenced by [[Quantum Artefact]] or [[Quantum Card]](On one time use) with the [[Vital Spectrum]] affinity.

It can also be affected by status effects such as : [[Blood Loss]], [[Burn]], [[Frostbite]] and [[Poison]].
#### Resonance Points (RP)

Resonance Points define the amount of power [[Tuners]] before being unable to use their powers or in extreme case even perceive what they normally could. It is affected by [[Resonance]] (Amount of RP, Exhaust time, Recovery time), and hidden stats.

it can also be affected by [[Quantum Artefact]], [[Quantum Card]](On one time use), [[Quantum Crystal]](by absorbing it's energy) and skills.

it can also be affected by status effects such as : [[Madness]], [[Poison]], and [[Quantum Blight]].
#### Stamina Points (SP)

Stamina Points define the amount of endurance you have before complete physical exhaustion (0 SP). It is affected by [[Stamina]] (Amount of SP, Exhaustion time, Recovery time), [[Health Points (HP)]](The more you are injured, the more you are exhausted. If you are in good health you will recover faster), [[Focus Points (FP)]](If your mind is exhausted, your body will be affected), and [[Resonance]](if you use or have affinity with the [[Kinetic Spectrum]] or [[Vital Spectrum]], it can affect Exhaustion and Recovery time) or even hidden stats.

It can also be influenced by [[Quantum Artefact]] or [[Quantum Card]](On one time use) with the [[Kinetic Spectrum]] or [[Vital Spectrum]] affinity.

it can also be affected by status effects such as : [[Blood Loss]], [[Frostbite]], [[Poison]], and [[Quantum Blight]].

The [[Skill Monolith]] appearance and environment is influenced by [[Dimensional Affinity]] and [[Spectrum Affinity]].
#### Skills

Skills are special methods and paths to [[Resonance]] power uses to create supernatural phenomenon in [[Dimensions]] according to the [[Spectrum of Reality]] affected.

They have specific costs and are stored in the [[Skill Monolith]].
### Specs

#### Classes

[[Classes]] describe the job of an entity, it is acquired during an Node Advancement Ritual and have specific rewards and effects on the entity that owns it.

When reaching the level cap of a node you can close your knot to attempt a Node Advancement Ritual and receive a class.
